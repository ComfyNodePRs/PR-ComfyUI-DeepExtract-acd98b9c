of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

              Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are aware that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make sure that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we insist that any patent license must ensure your freedom to use or redistribute the program in a free way.

Therefore, we demand the effective use of the GNU General Public License to make sure that everyone else also gets the same freedoms that we do.

                      TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensor" refers to the individual or organization that offers the Program under this License.

"Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

"A compilation" is a collection of separate works put together in one place.

"Adaptation" means a work based on the Program, or on a work based on the Program.

"Combined Work" means a work that combines the Program with other separate works.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must not remove any copyright notices from the Program.

c) You must not add any other conditions that contradict this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    1) Decrease the fee to the total of the actual cost of your copying and distributing the object code or executable form.

    2) Offer access to the source code for a reasonable fee upon request.

    3) Provide the information required to obtain the source code from a public repository.

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code or executable form, a copy of the corresponding source code for a fee not exceeding your cost of physically performing this distribution.

4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

5. You are not allowed to change the license of a combined work that you create from the Program. If you distribute the combined work, it must remain under this License.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on it), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or works based on it. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.

7. There is no warranty for the Program, and it is provided on an "as-is" basis. If you encounter any issues, you bear the risk.

8. If you create a combined work from the Program, you must clearly identify the parts of the work that are based on the Program and retain this License with them.

9. If you have received this License, you are bound by its terms. If you don't comply with its terms, you cannot use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program.

10. If you don't comply with the License, you cannot use the Program or any work based on it.

11. The licenses created under this License must be identified as "GPL-3.0".

12. The GPL license is compatible with software patents. If you distribute software that contains patent restrictions, you must inform the recipients that they cannot use the software in a proprietary manner.

This license does not permit you to impose additional restrictions on the rights granted by this License. This includes requirements to pay fees or to comply with additional licensing terms.

This License guarantees that you will be able to use the Program without charge and without fear of additional restrictions.
